# Group Theory for Graph Learning

This repository explores the role of group-theoretic structures in graph learning, with a focus on symmetry, invariance, and equivariance in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and related models.

The goal is to develop a mathematically grounded perspective on graph representation learning by linking concepts from group theory—such as group actions, automorphism groups, and representations—to modern graph learning frameworks.

This repository serves as a research notebook rather than a software library.

## Motivation

Graph-structured data often exhibit rich symmetries arising from node permutations and structural equivalences. Understanding these symmetries is essential for analyzing the expressive power, generalization, and limitations of graph learning models.

Group theory provides a natural language for describing these symmetries. By studying how groups act on graphs and their associated feature spaces, we can better understand invariance and equivariance properties in GNN architectures.
