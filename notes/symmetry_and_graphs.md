# Symmetry in Graph-Structured Data

Symmetry in graphs arises from node permutations that preserve adjacency relations. Formally, these symmetries are captured by the automorphism group of a graph.

Understanding graph symmetries is central to learning on graphs, as most graph learning tasks require representations that are invariant or equivariant under node relabeling.

This note introduces the basic concept of symmetry in graphs and motivates the use of group-theoretic language in graph learning.
