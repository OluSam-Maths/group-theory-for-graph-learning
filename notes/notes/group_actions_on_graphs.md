# Group Actions on Graphs

Let G be a group acting on the vertex set V of a graph. This action induces transformations that preserve the graph structure.

We study how group actions formalize node permutations and how these actions extend naturally to feature spaces associated with graph nodes.

This framework provides a foundation for understanding equivariant mappings in graph neural networks.
