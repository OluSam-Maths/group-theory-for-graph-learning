# Graph Automorphisms and Invariance

The automorphism group Aut(G) of a graph consists of all permutations of vertices that preserve adjacency.

Graph-level prediction tasks require representations invariant under Aut(G), while node-level tasks often require equivariant representations.

This note discusses how invariance constraints arise naturally from group actions and their role in graph learning.
