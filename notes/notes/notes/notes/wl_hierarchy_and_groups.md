# Weisfeiler–Lehman Hierarchy and Group-Theoretic Perspectives

The Weisfeiler–Lehman (WL) hierarchy provides a framework for analyzing the expressive power of graph learning algorithms.

From a group-theoretic viewpoint, limitations of the WL test are related to graph symmetries and automorphism groups.

This note explores how group theory provides insight into the strengths and limitations of GNN architectures.
